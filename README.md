# SaintsStories

This project is a kind of online Journal for registered members to write down their stories.
The stories of God's dealings in their lives. The project is designed using NODE JS, Express,
and MongoDB as the database for storing their stories. The authentication for registered members
is through google accounts. We will also integrate other microservices providers with time.
You can become a member of our Online stories teller. God bless you.
